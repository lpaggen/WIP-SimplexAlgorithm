This is a work in progress.

The aim of the project is to provide solutions to linear optimization problems using the simplex algorithm, only using NumPy to do so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
? Why not use linear algebra libraries ? 
-> This is a practice project and the point is to write the Simplex algorithm from scratch

? Why are most methods private ?
-> The user has no need to access any other method than the one to solve the problem

? Will this be updated ? 
-> If my way of writing this algorithm works, more functionalities will eventually be added
